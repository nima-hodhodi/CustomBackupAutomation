# Custom Backup Automation on Kubernetes  

This repository provides an automated backup solution for various databases and object storage systems (e.g., **InfluxDB**, **MongoDB**, and **MinIO**) running on Kubernetes.  
The solution is built around a **custom Docker image** and a **Kubernetes CronJob** to schedule and manage backups.
